15 : 8xCjnmgoKbGLhHFAZlGE5Tmu4M2tKJQo
connected to port 30000 of localhost to obtain password for level 15
used: nc localhost 30000
and pasted level 14 password and pw for level 15 was returned

14 : MU4VWeTyJk8ROof1qqmcBPaLh7lDCPvS
password obtained by accessing etc/bandit_pass/bandit14


second password is correct for level 1
13 > 14 : no password is needed, we had a file with a ssh key to log into 
the next level bandit14, the line used was:
ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220


12 > 13: FO5dwFsc0cbaIiH0h8J2eUks2vdTDwAn
took a while to figure this one out but in the end it was pretty simple
just had to decompress/revert the file until got the password
used xxd, tar, gzip, bzip2 and file


11 > 12 : 7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4
a bit harder, had to rotate the characters by 13 letters, for that i used:
cat data.txt | tr '[A-Za-z]' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m]'
cat data.txt to display the text alongside with
tr '[A-Za-z]' '[N-ZA-Mn-za-m]' to translate using all ch from 'A' to 'Z' and
'a' to 'z' plus decode from 13th letter (n) going from 'N' to end of alphabet
'Z' continuing with 'A' to 13th - 1 letter 'M' and same for small caps
'n-za-m' 


10 > 11: dtR173fZKb0RRsDFSGsg2RWnpNVj3qRr
this one was simple, used base64 -d data.txt


9 > 10: FGUW5ilLVJrxX9kMYMmlN4MgbpfMiqey
for this level i used the strings command with grep
strings to print readable characters and grep to get the ===== before the pw


8 > 9: 4CKMh1JI91bUIZZPXDqGanal4xvAg0JM
sort data.txt | uniq -u
uniq -u to find non duplicated lines, but we must sort data.txt first
because uniq only checks for **consecutive** duplicated lines


7 > 8 : dfwvzFQi4mU0wfNbFOe9RoWskMLg7eEc
grep -i 'millionth' data.txt
to find the password next to the word 'millionth'


6 > 7 : morbNTDkSW6jIlUc0ymOdMaLnOlFVAaj
find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null



file is human-readable, 1033 bytes and not executable
find ./inhere -type f -size 1033c
seatch for type files of exactly 1033 bytes

file is hiden in ./ folder
pw 3 > 4: 2WmrDFRmJIq3IPxneAaMGhap0pFhF3NJ


pw 0 > 1: ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If

since the file is called "-", in order to use cat and it not think that it's 
an argument, we must specify the full location: cat ./-
result: pw 1 > 2 263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx

file is has spaces, so we use '' to call it
pw 2 > 3 MNk8KNH3Usiio41PRUEoDFPqfxLPlSmx
