this one was simple, used base64 -d data.txt

for this level i used the strings command with grep
strings to print readable characters and grep to get the ===== before the pw

sort data.txt | uniq -u
uniq -u to find non duplicated lines, but we must sort data.txt first
because uniq only checks for **consecutive** duplicated lines

grep -i 'millionth' data.txt
to find the password next to the word 'millionth'

since the file is called "-", in order to use cat and it not think that it's 
an argument, we must specify the full location: cat ./-
result: pw 1 > 2 263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx

file is has spaces, so we use '' to call it
